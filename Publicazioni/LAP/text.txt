Finite Element Software (FES) is a Matlab/C++ framework for the development of "ad-hoc" simulation software aimed to rapid implementation of novel numerical methods based on the weighted residuals mathematical approach. Able to interact with geometries to generate meshes, one can straightforwardly implement numerical assembly and solve code to achieve a fast and robust simulation tool. This book shows that a few notions of mathematics and physics, and some coding skills, enable the development of powerful and efficient numerical tools relying on freely available libraries. Numerical simulation has never been as accessible to everyone as it is nowadays, pushing further the boundaries of simulation technologies development. Easy to use development codes enable a faster real-world models validation, a rough trial-and-error phase, through physical measurements. Commercial software remains of a paramount importance in the way that techniques implemented by researchers all over the world become spread over a much wider community of technologists, denoting their maturity.
